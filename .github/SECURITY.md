## Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Deployment Security
- Use HTTPS in production
- Configure proper authentication
- Regularly update dependencies
- Monitor security advisories
- Implement network security controls

#### Configuration Security
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Enable audit logging
- Configure proper permissions
- Regular security assessments

### For Developers

#### Code Security
- Follow secure coding practices
- Input validation and sanitization
- Proper error handling
- Secure authentication implementation
- Regular dependency updates

#### Development Process
- Security code reviews
- Static analysis tools
- Dependency scanning

- Secure CI/CD practices

## Known Security Considerations

### Authentication
- SelfCoE supports multiple auth providers
- Default guest authentication is for development only
- Production requires proper authentication setup

### Authorization
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Plugin-specific permissions
- Catalog entity permissions

### Data Protection
- Sensitive data in configuration
- Database security
- API endpoint protection
- Secret management

### Network Security
- HTTPS enforcement
- CORS configuration
- Rate limiting
- Input validation

## Security Updates

### Distribution
Security updates are distributed through:
- GitHub Security Advisories
- Release notes
- Email notifications (if subscribed)
- Community channels

### Applying Updates
1. Review security advisory
2. Test in staging environment
